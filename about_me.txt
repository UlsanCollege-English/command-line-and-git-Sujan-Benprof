Hello, I am Sujan Tamang from Nuwakot, Nepal. I was born in a middle class Happy family as the last member. In 2003 AD, my family moved from Nuwakot to Kathmandu so I could get good education and good life. About my educational backgrond,  I complete my secondary education (Upto 10th grade) from public school in 2018 and complete my +2 levels from the well known college in nepal in Management faculty with computer science as major. 

When i completed my +2 level, My curiousness increased towards the technology. I began wandoring how the intire technolgy works, how internet is build and why it bacame popular and so on. To pursue higher eduction, I searched for qualtiy education in Nepal by using internet, asking seniors tech students. Overall, I came to knew that their were no any quality edutaion in my country. So, I made my mind to go in S. Korea and continue further understanding regarding the technology. Precisely, I choosed this course. By choosing this course, i belived that i have a better and brighter future.
